Codes in the folder "coupled_without_feedback" are for simulating the system without feedback. 
The files with "mass" and "Hill" correspond to the mass action and Hill-function models, respectively.

For simulating the mass action (or Hill-function) model, do the following steps:
1. run server_mass_mGAP.m (or server_Hill_mGAP.m) to randomly sample the kinetic parameter and calculate the DoRA metric for each parameter set;
2. run plot_mass_sample.m (or plot_Hill_sample.m) to plot the upper panel in Figure 2B (or Figure 2D);
3. run plot_mass_server.m (or plot_Hill_server.m) to plot middle and bottom panels in Figure 2B (or Figure 2D) and the left panel in Figure 5B (or Figure 5D)

For simulating the mass action (or Hill-function) model, do the following steps:
1. run server_mass.m (or server_Hill_OR.m, server_Hill_AND.m ) to randomly sample the kinetic parameter and calculate the DoRA metric for each parameter set;
2. run plot_mass_sample.m (or plot_Hill_sample.m) to plot the upper panel in Figure 3B (or Figure 3D);
3. run plot_mass_server.m (or plot_Hill_server.m) to plot middle and bottom panels in Figure 3B (or Figure 3D), Figure 4A (or Figure 4C), and the right panel in Figure 5B (or Figure 5D)


The data generated by the above matlab codes were put in the foloder "Matlab datasets".
