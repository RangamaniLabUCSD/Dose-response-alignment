Codes in this file are for simulating the system without feedback. 
The files with "mass" and "Hill" correspond to the mass action and Hill-function models

For simulating the mass action (or Hill-function) model, do the following steps:
1. run server_mass_mGAP.m (or server_Hill_mGAP.m) to randomly sample the kinetic parameter and calculate the DoRA metric for each paramter set;
2. run
